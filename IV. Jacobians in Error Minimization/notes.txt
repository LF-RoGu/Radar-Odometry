The position error is minimized by adjusting 
𝑇 to align 𝑃 and 𝑄

ρ: Geman McClure kernel reduces outlier influence.

V. Role of Jacobians in Error Minimization
Why Jacobians:
Jacobians linearize non-linear equations, simplifying optimization.

VI. Rigid Body Geometry
Benefit:
Ensures physical constraints (e.g., no deformation), improving transformations.

VII. Radial Velocity and Velocity Errors
Expected Velocity:
Radial velocity 𝑉𝑘 aligns the vehicle’s motion with sensor measurements.
