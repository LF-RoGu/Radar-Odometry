Key Observations from the Lecture:

Sparse Radar Points:
Radar point clouds are sparse and may contain noise.
A single scan may not provide enough data for accurate alignment.

Submap Aggregation:
To handle sparsity, a submap is built by combining ten previous scans.
This improves context and robustness for the alignment process.

Two Steps in Each Iteration:
Find Correspondences: Match current scan points to the submap using Euclidean distance.
Minimize Error: Optimize the transformation by minimizing the error between matches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Explanation:
Submap Creation:

Combines 10 previous scans into a single submap.
Mimics the process described in the lecture to address sparsity in radar data.
Current Scan Transformation:

Applies a 15-degree rotation and (0.5, 1.0) translation to simulate motion.
Visualization:

Shows:
Submap (gray) → Represents the aggregated historical context.
Current scan (blue) → Raw data before applying transformation.
Transformed scan (green) → Updated scan after applying transformation.
Point Correspondences:

Draws dashed lines to visualize the correspondences between points before and after transformation.

How Does This Relate to the Lecture?
Submap Aggregation:
Combines past scans to handle sparse radar data, providing richer context for ICP matching.
Transformation with Error Minimization:
Prepares the data for error minimization using Jacobian-based optimization, which we'll expand on later.
ICP Workflow:
Matches the current scan to the submap and iteratively minimizes errors between correspondences.

Submap Size with 30 FPS Sampling Rate
Sampling at 30 FPS implies you receive 30 frames (scans) per second.

The minimum submap size of 10 scans covers 1/3rd of a second (10 scans / 30 FPS = 0.33 seconds).

Why 10 Scans?

It ensures robustness by aggregating spatial data over time.
Reduces the impact of sparse measurements and noisy points by providing context from prior scans.
Allows detection of consistent structures and reduces the influence of dynamic objects (e.g., moving pedestrians or vehicles).
At 30 FPS, a submap with 10 scans is a balanced compromise between:
Capturing sufficient past data for alignment.
Keeping the computational load manageable for real-time processing.

[!]Larger submaps (e.g., 20–30 scans) may improve stability for slow-moving vehicles, but:
Increase memory usage and computation time.
May include outdated information if the vehicle moves quickly.
